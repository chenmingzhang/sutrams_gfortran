#### if you just wish to run precompiled SutraMS_tide in WINDOWS environment:

SutraMS_tide has been precompiled as **SutraMS_tide_gf_windows.exe** in the directory *bin*. The associated **dlls** are also included in **bin** folder. This exe file has a alias (or shortcut) in folder *bin* named *SutraMS_tide.bat* that can be copied to any of your simulation folders.
(We do not suggest copying the exe (SutraMS_tide_gf_windows.exe) and associated dlls file into the simulation directories for running SutraMS_tide.)

To allow *SutraMS_tide.bat* to be copied and executed in any of your simulation folders, you will need to add the absolute address of directory *bin* into the system environment variables.

For example: 

If **SutraMS_tide** is located in *d:\SutraMS_tide*, the aboslute address of directory *bin* is *d:\SutraMS_tide\bin*. you will need to add *d:\SutraMS_tide\bin* in to your system environment variable.

The way to add path into system enviroment variables can be found from here:

After this, you will be able to copy *SutraMS_tide.bat* into any of your simulation folders and run the simulation by double clicking the file.
