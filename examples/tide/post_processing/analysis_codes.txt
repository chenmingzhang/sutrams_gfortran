LABTIDE_average(ts,nfwbc,nswbc)
% ts - Total number of timestep to parse data (in this Ex: 114 secs)
% nfwbc = nfwbc; % Number of pressure-specified nodes of the freshwater boundary (in this Ex: 0, flux control)
% nswbc = nswbc; % Number of pressure-specified nodes of the saltwater boundary (in this Ex: 421)

PLOT CONTOUR
LABTIDE_contour(param,ts)
% ts - the timestep number whose data will be based on to plot contour
% param - Choose data to be plotted (4: pressure; 5: species #1; 6: species #2; etc.)

PLOT VELOCITY VECTORS
LABSLP_quiver(ts,scale)
% ts - the timestep number whose data will be based on to plot velocity vectors
% scale - Scale the size of velocity vectors

PLOT STREAMLINE FROM A SPECIFIED POINT
LABTIDE_streamline(ts,startx,startz)
% ts - the timestep number whose data will be based on to plot streamline
% startx - x coordinate of the starting point
% startz - z coordinate of the starting point
